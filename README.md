# Fingerprinting
A Python implementation of Clarke and Minella (2016) method of measures the increase in uncertainty when sampling sediment fingerprinting. The full explanation of this method is avaliable in the paper "Evaluating sampling efficiency when estimating sediment source contributions to suspended sediment in rivers by fingerprinting". DOI: 10.1002/hyp.10866.

The  main source code is the fingerprint file which contains functions for the 4 steps described on paper such as resampling, solve, evaluate confidence region, plot and mores. The quick_start.ipynb  file is a jupyter notebook with basic samples of how to use this codes. The sampledata.xls is a input data file example.
